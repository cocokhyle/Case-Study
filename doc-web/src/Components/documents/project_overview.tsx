      <p>
        The solution is built around a static web application deployed in a
        Kubernetes cluster. This application is designed with structured logging
        to generate logs that simulate different application behavior and
        identify anomalies.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system integrates with Prometheus and Splunk to gather metrics and
        logs, offering both real-time monitoring and historical records based on
        the application performance and cluster health and status. Using
        Splunk-based alerting, we can be notified for potential performance
        issues and operational failures. Using Prometheus-based logging we can
        monitor the web application's health and performance by capturing
        metrics such as HTTP request/response rates, error counts, and system
        resource usage. This data can be used for alerting and visualization.
        With Splunk-based logging, it provides in-depth insights into error
        patterns, trace logs, and other critical data points such as response
        code, time, log level, etc.{" "}
